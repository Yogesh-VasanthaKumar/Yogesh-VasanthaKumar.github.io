# Color Changing Background Button

This is a simple web page that allows you to change the background color by clicking a button. The background color changes to different predefined hex colors each time you click the "Color" button.

## Usage

1. Open the [Color Changing Background Button](https://yogesh-vasanthakumar.github.io/assignment10/index.html) in your web browser.

2. Click the "Color" button to cycle through different background colors.

## How It Works

The webpage is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

- The HTML structure defines a button and includes a `script` tag for the JavaScript code.
- The JavaScript code defines an array of hex color codes and a variable to keep track of the current color index.
- The `color()` function is called when the button is clicked. It increments the index, resets it if it goes beyond the array length, and updates the background color of the `body` element using the selected color.
